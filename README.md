## Predicting Probability of Default of Lending Club loans

### Lending Club
Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Lending Club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers. For such companies who are in the lending business, calculating the probability of default can help estimate the expected income in the near term. For banks this can be used to ensure that they meet the regulatory capital requirements. 

### Project Objective
In this project I am going to build a model to predict the probability of deafult(or charge off) in the next month of the loans issued by lending club.
